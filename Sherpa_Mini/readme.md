## Mini Stealth - Sherpa Mini

This version of the Mini Stealth is based on the [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) mounting pattern and can fit the [ProtoXtruder](https://www.printables.com/model/436425-protoxtruder) extruder as well. There are subfolders with the shrouds and other components specific to each extruder.

For more information, questions and feedback, I am most active at [TeamFDM.com](https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/657-mini-stealth-mini-sherpa/?tab=comments) but the files here are the most current.
