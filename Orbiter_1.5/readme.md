## Mini Stealth - Orbiter 1.5

There are two filament release levers available for the Orbiter 1.5. The default version works best while the alternative version fits the modified idler arm and just allows adding some color to the extruder.

The release lever fits over the M3x20 SHCS securing the stepper motor and uses it as the pivot point. It is designed around a smooth socket head cap screw that should have an outer diameter of 5.4mm.
