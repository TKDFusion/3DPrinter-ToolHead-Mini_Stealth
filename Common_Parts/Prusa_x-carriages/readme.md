## Prusa X-Carriage

![Prusa1](Prusa_PINDA.png)

I have designed a backplate that allows the Mini Stealth to be installed onto a Prusa MK3 series printer. It might fit the MK4 as well but I cannot validate this.

This setup should fit most all of the hotends supported by the Mini Stealth. The extruders with low seating stepper motors will have collision issues with the upper LM8UU bearings. The following extruders should be viable options but may still be a tight fit:

- Sherpa Mini

- Sherpa Micro

- Galileo 2 SA

- WristWatch BMG

- WristWatch G2

- Vz Hextrudort CNC

- LGX Lite

- Hummingbird

- Creality K1

It uses a new, more rigid, set of core pieces that I am still working on. They are only available for the Sherpa Mini as of yet but this should change soon. I kept the Prusa geometry and assembly as similar to standard as possible but this design does require eight M3x4x5 heat-set inserts; four to assemble the x-carriage and four to mount the Mini Stealth. It still uses one M3 square nut and an M3 hex nut to secure the stock Prusa cable-holder.
