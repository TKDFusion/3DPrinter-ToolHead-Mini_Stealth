### Filament Release Lever

This is a filament release lever for the [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) extruder. The stock *housing core* and *idler arm* need to be replaced with the .stl files here. The pivot for the release lever is an M3x8 flathead screw.

I still need to work up new Mini Stealth shrouds with a cutout for the lever but this will work fine with any of the Crop Top versions.
