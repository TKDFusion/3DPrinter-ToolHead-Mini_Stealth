## Mini Stealth - LGX Lite

The LGX Lite version of the Mini Stealth will also fit the [Hummingbird](https://www.printables.com/model/367706-hummingbird-extruder) and the [Vz Hextrudort-Low CNC](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-HextrudORT) extruders. There are subfolders with the shrouds and other components specific to each extruder.

For more information, questions and feedback, I am most active at [TeamFDM.com](https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/616-mini-stealth-lgx-lite/?tab=comments) but the files here are the most current.
